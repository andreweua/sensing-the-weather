# Sensing the Weather

![Sensing the weather cover image](cover.png)

This scheme of work introduces students to the sensors included with the Raspberry Pi Weather Station, a project which aims to get schoolchildren building and programming their own Weather Station to collect and present data. These resources introduce some simple sensors and get the students writing Python code to gather data from them.

## Lessons

- [Rainfall](lesson-1/lesson.md) - gather data using polling and interrupt methods
- [Wind Speed](lesson-2/lesson.md) - calculate wind speed using circle theory
- [Wind Gust Speed](lesson-3/lesson.md) - store multiple sensor readings in a list
- [Wind Direction](lesson-4/lesson.md) - discover the difference between analogue and digital
- [Soil Temperature](lesson-5/lesson.md) - plot a graph of sensor results
- [Ambient Temperature](lesson-6/lesson.md) - compare data from two sensors
- [Relative Humidity](lesson-7/lesson.md) - use equations and look up values in a dictionary
- [Air Quality](lesson-8/lesson.md) - tweet sensor values from your Weather Station
- [Barometric Pressure](lesson-9/lesson.md) - write data to a CSV file to use in another program
